The problem is, that when you remove everything on a page, it returns null.
This is a problem when using the page to check if any changes where made.

So if the old page was empty (null), then the new page cannot be compared to it.
And vice versa.

I think I fixed it, but it somehow returns null every time.

A couple days later, don't actually know what the error is, it may be a false positive, but
I'll try to implement a way of ignoring if a player's name or something is removed from the notebook.

Wait... Can't we just remove the 'incorrect name' message?
Nice, it works.

Now it's time to improve the guide.
Next, I'll need to add different ways a player can die.
Like:
- Lightning strike ✔
- Enderman starring at them and then dying of a heart attack? ❌
- Getting consumed by the ground?
-

Now I'm working on adding a feature so that the book's first two pages get reset on edit.
Hmm, I'm having issues trying to remove and set the bookmeta.
I'm thinking about maybe deleting the book and then giving a new book to the player.
